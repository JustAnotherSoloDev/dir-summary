# dir-summary

This is a command line tool that I created to learn rust.

This tool can read a directory and generates a summary report in CSV to identify which files and directories are taking space in your system.

It operates in different modes run the tool and it will provide the details.

The package now can be compiled into c dlls that can be used in other languages like python.
